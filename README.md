# JG-Fitness
Fitness application that helps users manage their weight while creating new workouts/ finding new workouts. Users are also able to communicate using the forums to discuss many different topics.

Still have work to do- any feedback is great.

Next for update:
Enhance UI/UX in creating custom workouts in CRUD operation. Currently functionally works- looks decent with bootstrap but still needs some additional work done,
Incorporate Graphs/ Google charts/D3.js or any other charting library to BMI chart to let users have a better UI/UX experience.
